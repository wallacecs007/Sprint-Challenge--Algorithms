#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - This is O(n) as it is linear. Since we have three multiplications of n in the while statement and then we set a to a + n _ n we have two multiplications here. Since we have two multiplications in the body of the while statement, and three up top, we know that we will just be repeating the body n times as n _ n \* n can we rewritten as follows with the body of the equation:

 <!-- (n*n) * n = x(n*n) -->

Where x can be made equal to n.

b)

c)
